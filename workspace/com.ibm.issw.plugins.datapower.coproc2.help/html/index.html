<p>
The Eclipse Co-Processor provides a tool for submitting stylesheets
to run remotely on DataPower from a developer's workspace.  It was
composed of two parts.
</p>
<ul>
<li>a service on a DataPower appliance for running submitted stylesheets</li>
<li>a plug-in to the IDE that submitted the stylesheets</li>
</ul>
<p>
As of DataPower's 3.8.2 firmware release the CoProc, as it's often
known, has been deprecated.   This prompted an unofficial replacement
by Hermann Stamm-Wilbrandt
called CoProc2 to appear on the DataPower forums.  It is comprised of
a multi-protocol gateway (MPGW) for running the stylesheet and a Java
class for submitting it.  The Java class could be run from any command
line.
</p><p>
The original co-proc was very limited in the scope of DataPower APIs
it could accommodate in a stylesheet.  CoProc2 has no such limitation
since it runs in a MPGW just as it would in an actual service.  The
current drawback to CoProc2 is that it only runs from a command line.
When developing in Eclipse, a Java run configuration can be used to
automate this.  But its configuration is awkward.  Hence this CoProc2
plug-in was created to provide an Eclipse run configuration specifically
for CoProc2.
</p><p>
This original version of the CoProc2 feature, 1.0.0, is a prototype
released for the purpose of gathering feedback.  It was written as a
learning process for how to develop Eclipse run configurations; and
much still remains to be learned.  Any suggestion and/or tips on
developing run configurations on how to make this one more useful
is welcome.
