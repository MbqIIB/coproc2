CoProc2 Eclipse Plug-in
=======================

The CoProc2 Eclipse plug-in wraps the CoProc2 Java class inspired by 
[Hermann's BLOG Post](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/HermannSW/entry/coproc2_again_integration_in_eclipse44?lang=en).
The wrapper takes the form of an **Eclipse Run Configuration**,
which is the mechanism we use in Eclipse to run other Java-based
actions such as run a stand-alone Java program, run an application
test environment, run an applet, or a JUnit test.  In this case,
the configuration panel is oriented to running Hermann's CoProc2.

In order to use the latest version of the CoProc2 plug-in, you
have to use the MPGW that corresponds to it.  You can download
this along with an *CoProc2 Installation Guide* from [Paul Glezen's
Homepage](http://glezen.org/).
